> These are the revelations of Ivaela of Ithelren—student of Shaama of the Great Library; subject of Shaenna, first of her name, Queen of Ithelren and Flower of the World—compiled on her travels across the seas. May the muses grant her clarity of thought and eloquence of pen that she may recount in truth and with beauty that which she is compelled to tell.

Here I have recorded the histories, cultures, geographies, flora, and fauna of the world.
I have sought to record these things as is proper and true by Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, and is beautiful and eloquent by Deneir, Lord of Writing.

May this tome be preserved and shared for the good of all the world as deemed proper by the Great Library in Alushtor, by Ithelren, and by the Crown of Flower of the World and the head upon whom it rests.
